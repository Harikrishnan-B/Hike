    <p class="lorem-text">History of Hike <br>
      Early Beginnings (1964-1971) <br>
      Hike's roots can be traced back to 1964 when University of Oregon track athlete Phil Knight and his coach Bill Bowerman founded Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS). The company originally functioned as a distributor for the Japanese shoe brand Onitsuka Tiger, now known as ASICS. Knight sold the shoes out of his car at track meets, while Bowerman experimented with improving the design of the running shoes. <br>
      
      Birth of Hike (1971) <br>
      In 1971, BRS decided to launch its own line of footwear. Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student, was commissioned to create a logo for the new brand. She came up with the now-famous "Swoosh," which represents motion and speed. The name "Hike," named after the Greek goddess of victory, was chosen for the brand. The first Hike shoe, the Hike Cortez, was released during the 1972 U.S. Track and Field Trials.  <br>
      
      The brand has also embraced digital transformation, with the launch of Hike+, a platform that integrates technology with fitness and sports. Collaborations with celebrities, designers, and athletes have kept Hike at the forefront of fashion and sports culture. <br>
